Milestone 3:
1.	The Project was designed to be a use of led lights to make S.O.S. and OK in the lights on the board depending on which button on which side had been pressed. It was designed to blink morse code and could be used to pass messages.
2.	I feel like I had a good beginning to this project. I feel like I had the set up for a state machine that was good.
3.	I remember the entire assignment was a hard thing for me. I struggled with understanding what to do and even how to do it. I understand what I can do better, and I did even better on it when it came to the project.
4.	I am going to add more thought processing to my support network. I seemed to do better with this code and the other code when I sat back, and I thought about it even when I wasnâ€™t at home doing it. Something would suddenly connect a lot and I would see a path forward.
5.	I think the idea of writing out programs would be very helpful and would help in this and future programs and courses.
6.	I left comments with each section and made sure to label each section and what it was supposed to be doing.

Project:
1.	For this Project, I had to design a thermostat that would run off LED lights inside an embedded system.
2.	I had to design a couple state machines within a task scheduler and I did a good job at that I feel.
3.	I know that I missed a portion of the program where there was supposed to be a LED light when the heat went on and off. I know that my program was lacking that.
4.	I think the tools that I would add from this project is that I talked to my professor about what went wrong on the previous assignment to get this assignment right. So, I think it would be good to have someone to talk through the problems that I come across when I am working on projects.
5.	I think state machines and how to build them properly will be a very big skill to have for future assignments and classes.
6.	I made sure to have the project divided into different classes. I also made sure to set them all in a certain order. I then made sure to also make comments detailing how everything went and worked.
